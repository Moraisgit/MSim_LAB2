# Files
There are ```.m``` and ```.mat``` files in this repository. 

Some ```.m``` files were individually made for each question such as:
- ```Question2.m```
- ```Question3.m```
- ```Question5.m```

The file ```TCLab_openloop_modified.m``` was used to answer question 1 and is only a modification (as the name indicates) of the file ```TCLab_openloop.m``` given by the professors.

The file ```tclabsim.m``` corresponds to the function asked to be developed in question 4.

The ```.mat``` files contain variables used in the ```.m``` files and the code to load these ```.mat``` files is written in the ```.m``` files, when needed.
